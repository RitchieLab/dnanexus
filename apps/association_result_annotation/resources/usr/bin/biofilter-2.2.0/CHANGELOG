CHANGELOG

2.2.0 (2014-07-22)
- release

2.2.0b1 (2014-05-20)
- added support for "extra" input data to be stored with SNPs, positions,
  regions, genes and groups, and corresponding output columns snp_extra, etc.
- (LOKI) added support for parsing updated genome build identities from
  http://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQreleases.html
- (LOKI) added warnings for unrecognized genome builds which could lead to
  mismatched data
- (LOKI) added a tally of SNP role records with unrecognized Entrez GeneIDs

2.1.2b1 (2014-03-31)
- fixed a bug in the 'biopolymer_chr' output column (which is part of
  the 'generegion' output shortcut) which caused a crash with certain
  combinations of input data and requested output
- (LOKI) added support for HTTP (but not SOCKS) proxy servers for downloading
  source data via HTTP

2.1.1b1 (2013-08-21)
- fixed a bug in model expansion that caused some models to be duplicated in
  reverse order, and some types to be paired with themselves as a model

2.1.0 (2013-07-19)
- release

2.1.0rc1 (2013-07-18)
- REGION_POSITION_MARGIN is now applied when matching positions to
  upstream/downstream gene annotations
- added "gwas_rs" output option
- updated dbsnp loader to handle incomplete SNP roles in dbSNP's data download

2.1.0b1 (2013-06-11)
- added support for "upstream" and "downstream" gene annotation; the shorthand
  outputs provide the gene label and distance, but "_id", "_start" and "_stop"
  suffixes are also available (i.e. "upstream_start")
- added support for "gwas" catalog ananotation by way of RS# or chr/position,
  with a corresponding LOKI source loader; the shorthand output provides the
  trait, SNPs, OR/beta, allele 95% CI, risk allele frequency and PubMed ID

2.0.1b1 (2013-03-14)
- removed the file timestamp check in --verify-source-file; file size and hash
  should suffice, and not all sources provide stable timestamps anyway
- fixed a bug in the LOKI updater which would mask the original error if the
  error-handler itself caused an additional error

2.0.0 (2013-02-14)
- final 2.0 release

2.0.0rc2 (2013-01-25)
- added support for the special identifier type '=' to re-import *_id output
- added support for UTF8 encoding of input name files
- fixed a bug in the LOKI build process

2.0.0rc1 (2013-01-23)
- improved LOKI dbSNP update speed on network filesystems by up to 20x
- reduced the temporary storage requirements for building LD profiles by ~6x
  per population; without --keep-data, peak storage is ~10gb + 10gb per pop

2.0.0b7 (2012-12-05)
- fixed a bug in gene text search

2.0.0b6 (2012-11-29)
- fixed a bug when using --report-invalid-input with --report-configuration
- fixed a bug in --report-invalid-input for unrecognized/ambiguous identifiers

2.0.0b5 (2012-11-27)
- fixed a performance bug when using region input data
- fixed a bug that produced no results with certain input combinations

2.0.0b4 (2012-12-11)
- errors during LOKI source updates are now caught and reported, allowing the
  update process to continue with the other sources rather than crashing
- the LOKI build process skips finalization if any sources encounter errors

2.0.0b3 (2012-10-30)
- fixed a bug when requesting the same output column more than once
- fixed a bug in the reporting of ambiguous gene and group identifiers

2.0.0b2 (2012-10-29)
- fixed a bug in LD profile lookups
- clarified the error message when requesting a missing LD profile

2.0.0b1 (2012-10-16)
- first public release
