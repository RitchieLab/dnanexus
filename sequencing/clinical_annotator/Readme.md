# Annotate VCF File (DNAnexus Platform App)

Annotates a VCF File with most recent ClinVar TSV file downloaded from
ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/clinvar/tab_delimited/variant_summary.txt.gz
and with a user provided HGMD PRO vcf file.
Because of VCF Normalization difference some annotations will be skipped.  Does
not function with UCSC Chromosome labeling.  VCF will need to have chr 
prefix removed.

This is the source code for an app that runs on the DNAnexus Platform.
For more information about how to run or modify it, see
