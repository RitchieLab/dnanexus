# Determine Ancestry from PCA (DNAnexus Platform App)

## What does this app do?

This app determines ancestry from a PCA eigenvector file. It runs QDA (quadratic discriminant analysis) using a custom R script to determine posterior ancestries for all samples, even those in the training set.

## What data are required for this app to run?

This app requires:
- An eigenvector file (`*.evec`), as generated by the vcf_to_pca app
- A training data set listing known ancestries. This input is a tab-delimited file with two columns, `ID` and `RACE`. The entries in the `ID` column must match the IDs in the eigenvector file

## What does this app output?

Thia app outputs a tab-delimited file (`*.ancestry`) with three columns:
- `ID`: the same ID values as in the eigenvector file
- `race`: the race corresponding to the ID, as given in the training data set
- `prob`: the probability that the ID corresponds to the race
