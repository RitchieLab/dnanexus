# VCF Summary Statistics (DNAnexus Platform App)

This app takes as input variants VCF files in `*.vcf.gz` format and uses
biofilter to generate sample level summary statistics.

In the future, this app will also be able to generate variant-level summary
statistics. However, this option is not currently implemented.
